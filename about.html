        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Arun Pandyan Vasam, a dedicated and adaptable technology enthusiast currently based in Brampton, Ontario. I hold an Ontario College Diploma in Computer Programming from Sheridan College and a Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering from Vignan Institute of Technology and Science, India.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about building practical software solutions and enjoy the creative process of developing interactive web applications. I've developed projects like "Digital Cloak," an engaging real-time clock web page, and a "Multiplication Game" that generates dynamic multiplication questions, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical expertise in languages like Java, C, C#, PHP, and JavaScript, I have experience with frameworks such as Spring Boot, Angular, and .NET. I am also familiar with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and Azure SQL, and have worked with cloud platforms like AWS. I thrive in agile environments and am proficient with various development tools including Visual Studio Code, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA</p>
        <p>Professionally, I have gained valuable experience at Best Buy Canada as a Repack Associate, as well as at Crate and Barrel as a Fulfillment Associate, where I honed my time-management and organizational skills.</p>
        <p>When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy working in collaborative environments and adapting to dynamic challenges that allow me to grow and contribute meaningfully to my team. Feel free to explore my projects or reach out if you'd like to connect!</p>
